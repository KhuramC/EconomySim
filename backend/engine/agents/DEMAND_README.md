# Gathering Demand Parameters
Industries require an estimation of the demand for a good in order to calculate the new price.
One way of accomplishing this is to use the CES demand formula to find the quantity demanded at the 
current price, then finding the tangent line approximation at that point.
From there, the slope and price when quantity demanded is zero can be approximated.
Finally, the slope and q0 values can be aggregated among all person agents to find the demand for the entire model

Refer to this explanation for how the tangent line is approximated:
