# Git Cheat Sheet

The basic idea of Git is that you take "snapshots" of your work called **commits**. You do your work on a separate timeline called a **branch** to avoid messing up the main codebase. Then you share your commits by **pushing** your branch to a central online repository (like GitHub).

### 1. Starting Your Day & Getting the Latest Updates ‚òÄÔ∏è

This is the **first thing you should do every day** to make sure you have the most recent code from everyone else.

1.  **Switch to the main branch.**
    ```bash
    git switch main
    ```
2.  **Download and merge all changes from the remote repository.** This command fetches the updates and integrates them into your local copy.
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

### 2. Saving and Sharing Your Work (The Core Loop) üíæ

You've made some changes to the code and now you want to save them and share them with the team.

1.  **Check what you've changed.** This shows you a list of modified files.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
2.  **Add all your changes to the "staging area."** This prepares them for being saved in a snapshot. The `.` means "all files in this folder."
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Create the snapshot (commit).** Save your staged changes with a clear, descriptive message about what you did.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Describe your changes here, e.g., 'Added user login button'"
    ```
4.  **Upload (push) your saved commits to the remote repository.** This makes your work visible to everyone else.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

### 3. Starting a New Feature or Task üöÄ

Always create a new branch for each new task (e.g., building a new page, fixing a specific bug). This keeps your work isolated and safe from the main codebase.

1.  **First, make sure your `main` branch is up-to-date.** (See Scenario 1).
    ```bash
    git switch main
    git pull
    ```
2.  **Create a new branch and immediately switch to it.** Choose a descriptive name for your branch.
    ```bash
    git switch -c your-new-feature-name
    ```
    Now you can start coding! All your work will be saved on this new branch. When you're ready to save and share, just follow the steps in Scenario 2.

### 4. Combining Your Finished Feature into the Main Code ‚úÖ

Once your feature is complete and pushed, the best practice is to create a **Pull Request** (or Merge Request) on the project's GitHub/GitLab page. This lets the team review your code before it's officially merged into the `main` branch.

If you need to merge locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Switch to the main branch and make sure it's up-to-date.**
    ```bash
    git switch main
    git pull
    ```
2.  **Merge your feature branch into `main`.** This takes all the commits from your feature branch and applies them to the `main` branch.
    ```bash
    git merge your-new-feature-name
    ```
3.  **Push the updated `main` branch** to share the newly merged code.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

### 5. "Oops!" - Undoing Mistakes üò¨

Made a change you don't want? Here are some simple fixes.

- **To undo changes in a file that you have _not_ committed yet:** This will revert the file to how it was at the last commit.
  ```bash
  git restore FileName.js
  ```
- **To throw away ALL uncommitted changes since your last save:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use with caution!** This action cannot be undone.
  ```bash
  git restore .
  ```

### 6. Getting the Project for the First Time (One-Time Setup) üíª

If you've never worked on the project before, you need to download it to your computer.

1.  **Clone (download) the repository.** You only ever need to do this once per project. Get the URL from the project's GitHub page.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KhuramC/EconomySim.git
    ```
2.  **Tell Git who you are.** This is important so your commits are attributed to you. You only need to do this once per computer.
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```

### Golden Rule ‚ú®

**Commit often** with clear messages. Before you `push`, always `pull` to get the latest changes and avoid conflicts.
